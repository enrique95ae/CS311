//Purpose of the program: User enters a postfix operation to be solved and the program determines wheter or not the expression is valid and prints the result if it is.  
//Algorithm: There is a stack in which intergers are pushed, as soon as one operand is found the last two elements are popped and the result is calculated. The loop keeps going until there is no more intergers in the stack.
