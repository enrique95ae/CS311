//Program ALGORITHM:  

//Three vectors are declared. Along with a size and input variable.  
//We then ask for the sie of the vectors and for the elements that will be pushed into each vectors in a ascending order.  
//We push the elements into each vector.  
//The combine function is then called and we pass the vectors as well as the size to it.  
//This function will sort the elements as described below.  
//Lastly the result vector, once is sorted, is outputed.
